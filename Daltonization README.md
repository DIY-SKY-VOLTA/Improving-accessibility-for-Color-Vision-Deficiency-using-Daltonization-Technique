# Types of Color Vision Deficiency (CVD)

Color Vision Deficiency (CVD), commonly referred to as color blindness, affects the ability to perceive colors accurately. It can vary in severity and is typically classified into the following types:


### 1. **Protanopia**
- Complete inability to perceive red light.
- Red may appear black, and certain shades of orange, green, and yellow can be indistinguishable.


### 2. **Deuteranopia**
- Complete inability to perceive green light.
- Green and red hues may appear indistinguishable.


### 3. **Tritanopia**
- Complete inability to perceive blue light.
- Blue may appear green, and yellow may look pinkish or gray.


### 4. **Monochromacy (Achromatopsia)**
- No functional cone cells.
- Vision is entirely grayscale, and light sensitivity is often increased.

### 5. **Blue Monochromacy (Traitanomaly)**
- Improves bluescale contrasts

  
### 6. **Enhanced Green (Deutanomaly)**
- Improves greenscale contrasts

  
### 7. **Enhanced Red (Protanomaly)**
- Improves Redscale contrasts

## How to Test for Color Vision Deficiency
If you suspect you or someone else has CVD, tools like **Ishihara plates** or online tests can help identify the type and severity. However, a professional diagnosis by an optometrist is recommended.

## Applications for CVD Solutions
For individuals with CVD, technologies such as daltonization (color correction) or augmented reality overlays can enhance visual accessibility. Our project aims to address these challenges using **AI-based solutions** to improve video content accessibility.
