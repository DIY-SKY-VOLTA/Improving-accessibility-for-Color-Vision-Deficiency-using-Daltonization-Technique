# Types of Color Vision Deficiency (CVD)

Color Vision Deficiency (CVD), commonly referred to as color blindness, affects the ability to perceive colors accurately. It can vary in severity and is typically classified into the following types:

## 1. **Red-Green Color Vision Deficiency**
This is the most common type of CVD and involves difficulty in distinguishing between red and green hues.

### a. **Protanomaly** 
- Reduced sensitivity to red light.
- Red colors may appear more muted or brownish.

### b. **Protanopia**
- Complete inability to perceive red light.
- Red may appear black, and certain shades of orange, green, and yellow can be indistinguishable.

### c. **Deuteranomaly**
- Reduced sensitivity to green light.
- Greens and yellows may appear similar.

### d. **Deuteranopia**
- Complete inability to perceive green light.
- Green and red hues may appear indistinguishable.

## 2. **Blue-Yellow Color Vision Deficiency**
This type is less common and involves difficulty distinguishing between blue and yellow shades.

### a. **Tritanomaly**
- Reduced sensitivity to blue light.
- Blue may appear greenish, and yellow can appear pale or indistinct.

### b. **Tritanopia**
- Complete inability to perceive blue light.
- Blue may appear green, and yellow may look pinkish or gray.

---

## 3. **Monochromacy (Total Color Blindness)**
This is a rare form of CVD where individuals perceive no color at all. It is subdivided into:

### a. **Cone Monochromacy**
- Only one type of cone cell functions, leading to a limited color spectrum.

### b. **Rod Monochromacy (Achromatopsia)**
- No functional cone cells.
- Vision is entirely grayscale, and light sensitivity is often increased.

## How to Test for Color Vision Deficiency
If you suspect you or someone else has CVD, tools like **Ishihara plates** or online tests can help identify the type and severity. However, a professional diagnosis by an optometrist is recommended.

## Applications for CVD Solutions
For individuals with CVD, technologies such as daltonization (color correction) or augmented reality overlays can enhance visual accessibility. Our project aims to address these challenges using **AI-based solutions** to improve video content accessibility.
