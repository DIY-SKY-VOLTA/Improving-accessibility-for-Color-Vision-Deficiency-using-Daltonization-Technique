# Improved Octree Quantization Method (IOQM)

## Overview
The Improved Octree Quantization Method (IOQM) is used to extract key colors from each frame, creating an Extracted Cluster Palette (ECP) that represents significant colors within a reduced but effective color space. The ECP is then optimized by integrating spatial and temporal constraints, helpful to create datasets to train AI. The videos are first converted into a number of frames at periodic delays; next, each frame is converted into an extracted color palette (ECP). After simulations and recoloring processes are applied on those ECP, they are evaluated by an individual suffering from CVD.
