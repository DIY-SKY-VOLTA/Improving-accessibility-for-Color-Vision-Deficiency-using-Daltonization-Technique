# Color Vision Simulator

A **Color Vision Simulator** is a tool designed to emulate the perception of individuals with various types of Color Vision Deficiency (CVD). It helps in understanding how colors are seen by people with different color vision conditions, enabling better design decisions and accessibility improvements.

## How Does a Color Vision Simulator Work?
A Color Vision Simulator uses algorithms to transform images or user interfaces to represent how they would appear to someone with a specific type of CVD. These simulations can include:
- **Red-Green Deficiency (Protanopia, Deuteranopia)**
- **Blue-Yellow Deficiency (Tritanopia)**
- **Monochromacy (Achromatopsia)**

The simulator applies these filters to images, videos, or user interfaces in real-time or as a static transformation, mimicking the visual experience of individuals with CVD.

## Benefits for Educators and Developers

### 1. **For Educators**
Educators can use Color Vision Simulators to:
- Design teaching materials, such as diagrams, charts, and presentations, that are accessible to students with CVD.
- Identify color combinations that may be challenging for students with CVD and adapt them using more distinguishable colors or patterns.
- Foster inclusivity in educational environments by understanding and accommodating the needs of all learners.

### 2. **For Developers**
Developers can leverage Color Vision Simulators to:
- Test applications, websites, or software for accessibility issues related to color usage.
- Ensure compliance with accessibility standards, such as **WCAG 2.1** guidelines.
- Make informed decisions about color palettes and design choices to enhance usability for individuals with CVD.
- Build tools or applications that directly address challenges faced by color-blind users, such as daltonization filters or augmented reality solutions.

## Popular Color Vision Simulator Tools
Here are some widely used tools and libraries for simulating color vision deficiencies:
1. **Coblis (Color Blindness Simulator):** A web-based tool that allows users to upload images and view how they appear to individuals with various types of CVD.
2. **Sim Daltonism:** A macOS app that simulates color blindness in real-time for screen content.
3. **Color Oracle:** A desktop application for Windows, macOS, and Linux that shows simulated CVD perception.
4. **Daltonize.py:** A Python library that offers algorithms for both simulating and correcting color blindness.

## Why is This Important?
Color Vision Simulators bridge the gap in understanding how visual information is perceived by individuals with CVD. They enable:
- **Inclusive Design:** Helping creators design content accessible to everyone, regardless of their visual abilities.
- **Awareness:** Raising awareness about CVD and promoting empathy among educators, developers, and designers.
- **Enhanced User Experience:** Delivering better tools, learning environments, and user interfaces that cater to diverse visual needs.

## Applications
Our project integrates Color Vision Simulation as part of a broader initiative to:
- Assist developers and educators in testing their content for CVD accessibility.
- Provide AI-based solutions for real-time adaptations in educational and professional settings.
